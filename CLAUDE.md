# Working Notes for Claude - Co-aligning AI and Institutions

## Paper Structure

This academic paper on Full-Stack Alignment (FSA) has the following structure:
- 0-abstract.md: Core thesis and overview
- 1-introduction.md: Problem statement and paper roadmap
- 2-existing_toolkits.md: Critique of preference-based and text-based approaches
- 3-new_toolkit.md: Introduces explicit norm and value representation framework
- 4-case_studies.md: Five applications (AI value stewardship, normative competence, win-win negotiation, meaning-preserving economy, democratic regulation)
- 5-roadmap.md: Research and implementation strategy
- 6-conclusion.md: Summary and future directions
- 7-footnotes.md: References and annotations
- 8-related_work.md: Comparisons with adjacent fields

## Tone

- Maintain academic tone throughout
- Focus on technical precision and conceptual clarity
- Present critiques firmly but constructively
- Emphasize practical applications alongside theoretical foundations

## Collaboration Approach

### Concept Refinement
- When concepts feel vague, generate multiple interpretations (4-8)
- When exploring alternatives, provide brief descriptions rather than long paragraphs
- For important concepts, develop multiple choice options to clarify meaning
- Offer philosophical foundations for key concepts (e.g., "if values are for something...")

### Terminology Development
1. Brainstorm alternative phrasings (5-8 options) when renaming concepts
2. Test interpretations against the paper's existing framework
3. Verify consistency of terminology changes across all relevant files

### Content Structuring
- When adding new content, insert it in a way that maintains logical flow
- For key ideas like "attractors in value space", provide concrete examples (4+)
- Create clear conceptual distinctions with enumerated lists
- Maintain parallel structure between related sections (e.g., content vs. form)
- Distinguish between well-established examples and exploratory concepts

### Flow Improvement
- Identify and fix repetition and definitional inconsistencies
- Create explicit transitions between major sections that explain their relationship
- Ensure balanced treatment of parallel concepts (similar depth, structure, examples)
- Merge related concepts under common frameworks instead of treating separately
- Analyze argumentative flow by breaking down an entire section's structure

### Section Balancing
- Mirror structure across parallel sections (e.g., numbered items in both approaches)
- Balance depth of examples - give similar treatment to similar concepts
- Ensure transitions connect sections by explaining how they build on each other
- Create visual parallelism with consistent formatting (bullet points, numbering)
- Add concluding sentences that tie sections back to the overall argument

### Consistency Management
- After terminology changes, check all relevant files for needed updates
- Maintain consistent naming across introduction, body sections, and conclusion
- Ensure section headings align with content descriptions in introduction/conclusion
- When referencing other sections, use precise callbacks that match the target section's key concepts
- Ensure parallel structures across the paper (especially in critiques and their corresponding solutions)

### Structural Refinement
- When identifying organizational issues, suggest multiple alternative frameworks
- For complex critiques, organize by philosophical dimensions rather than surface features
- When sections contain overlapping critiques, identify and eliminate redundancies
- Use synthesizing conclusions that tie together related critiques rather than listing them separately
- Maintain balance between abstract critique and concrete examples
