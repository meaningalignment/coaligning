\section{Case Studies}
To demonstrate the practical value of FSA, let's take on five representative socio-technical alignment challenges. In each case, we'll show how structured representations of norms and values offer novel solutions where preference/utility frameworks and naive value-representations fal short.

\subsection{AI value‑stewardship agents}
Modern assistants can whisper in our ear thousands of times a day. Unless they \textit{guard} our richly‑textured ideals, they tend to nudge us toward the cheap dopamine that maximises watch‑time or clicks—a slide that researchers call \textbf{value collapse} \cite{stray2021}. The danger is not malicious takeover but quiet homogenisation: assistants that reshape what we care about and then faithfully serve the flattened proxy.

        \textbf{Socio-technical Challenge} & \textbf{Why Thin Models Break} & \textbf{Example FSA solution} & \textbf{Future FSA work} \\
        \midrule
        Stop assistants steering users into addictive spirals and shallow goals. &
        Revealed preferences are treated as ground truth \cite{gul2001}; free‑text constitutions drift under optimisation (Anthropic 2022). &
        Capture \textit{constitutive attentional policies} and weave them into a \textbf{personal moral graph} \cite{klingefjord2024} that users can endorse after reflection. &
        Values‑based RL plus \textit{evaluative‑understanding} tests that probe whether agents truly grasp thick moral concepts. \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}

\end{table*}

\subsection{Normatively competent agents}
Self‑driving cars can obey traffic law yet still barge through four‑way stops; content‑moderation AIs ban reclaimed slurs while missing their social purpose. Such errors illustrate \textbf{normative incompetence}—fitting the letter of rules while shredding their spirit. To keep institutions intact, autonomous systems must \textit{see} the living norms that humans follow and update with them.

\begin{table*}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \small
    \begin{tabular}{p{0.22\textwidth}p{0.22\textwidth}p{0.22\textwidth}p{0.22\textwidth}}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Socio-technical Challenge} & \textbf{Why Thin Models Break} & \textbf{Example FSA solution} & \textbf{Future FSA work} \\
        \midrule
        Track, honour and adapt to fluid social norms. &
        Pay‑off maximisers defect when incentives flip \cite{tversky1992}; plain‑language rules have no formal semantics. &
        Train on \textbf{norm‑augmented Markov games} that separate pay‑offs from norms (Oldenburg \& Zhi-Xuan 2024) and use \textit{resource‑rational contractualism} to universalise decisions (Jara‑Ettinger 2023). &
        Benchmarks for rapid norm‑learning, context inference, and contestable reasoning traces. \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Normatively competent agents: challenges and solutions}
    \label{tab:normative-competence}
\end{table*}

\subsection{Win‑win AI negotiation}
LLM delegates already draft contracts, schedule freight, and explore peace settlements. Left to thin rationality they default to brinkmanship—recent labs found LLM agents escalate faster than humans in diplomacy games (Bai et al. 2023). We need negotiators that treat cooperation as more than a trick of incentives.

        \textbf{Socio-technical Challenge} & \textbf{Why Thin Models Break} & \textbf{Example FSA solution} & \textbf{Future FSA work} \\
        \midrule
        Avoid Machiavellian escalation and exploitative deals. &
        Utility revelation makes promises cheap; open‑sourcing full code is infeasible \cite{oesterheld2022} and partial‑preference schemes lack trust (Hyafil \& Boutilier 2007). &
        \textbf{Value revelation}—share structured commitments that expose an agent's \textit{integrity} without revealing strategy. &
        Strategy‑proof revelation protocols and metrics that detect value fakery or bait‑and‑switch tactics. \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Win-win AI negotiation: challenges and solutions}
    \label{tab:negotiation}
\end{table*}

\subsection{A meaning‑preserving AI economy}
Finance now executes micro‑trades unconnected to human use‑value; social‑media platforms profit by hijacking attention \cite{orlowski2020}. These \textbf{human‑detached} and \textbf{human‑antagonistic} sectors flourish because markets optimise the signals they can see—money and clicks—not lived meaning. This misalignment is poised to grow massively in a near-future AI-powered economy.

        \midrule
        Redirect capital toward genuine human flourishing. &
        Manipulated demand still scores as welfare; fairness externalities ignored \cite{fehr1999}. &
        \textbf{Outcome‑based contracts} that route payouts to \textit{measured flourishing} via value graphs, backed by dynamic‑contracting tools \cite{philippon2015}. &
        Fraud‑resistant meaning metrics and mechanisms that propagate incentives through supply chains. \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}

\end{table*}

\subsection{Democratic regulation at AI speed}
An AI agent can close a trans‑border land deal in milliseconds; the affected citizens hear days later. Democracy faces a \textbf{speed mismatch} across time‑scale, jurisdiction, and expertise. If governance cannot catch up, legitimacy unravels and human agency is undermined.

        \textbf{Socio-technical Challenge} & \textbf{Why Thin Models Break} & \textbf{Example FSA solution} & \textbf{Future FSA work} \\
        \midrule
        Express the informed public will in real time across contexts. &
        Polling/voting is slow; abstract AI principles lack mandate; quadratic voting still needs richer value inputs (Goel et al. 2019). &
        Keep a \textbf{population‑scale moral graph} \cite{klingefjord2024} that LLM regulators cite in justifications and open for audit; combine with legitimation mechanisms (Conitzer 2023). &
        Algorithms for deliberative aggregation and reversible ``fast‑path'' oversight that can be appealed post‑hoc. \\
