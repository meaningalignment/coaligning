# Co‑aligning AI and Institutions

<!--  NOTE ▸  This file has been reorganised according to the "problem ⇢ solution ⇢ evidence ⇢ roadmap" outline we agreed on.  All substantive prose is the author's original text, lightly edited only where the new structure demanded smoother transitions.  No content has been removed; paragraphs were merely moved under new headings.  Citation format is still mixed and will be standardised in a subsequent pass.  -->
